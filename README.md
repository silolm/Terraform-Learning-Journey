## 🌍 About this Repository

This repository is my **public Terraform learning journey**: a hands-on path from absolute beginner to building **production-ready cloud architectures**.  

Each directory contains a self-contained project that documents a specific milestone in my progression, from creating a simple S3 bucket to designing modular, multi-environment infrastructure.  

The goal: **a transparent, version-controlled portfolio** that shows both my skills and growth in Infrastructure as Code, DevOps practices, and AWS cloud.
